### Focus on maintenance, Consistency over dogma, systems that fail in obvious, diagnosable ways. ###
### Be clear, not complete — senior answers stop earlier than feels comfortable. ###

<span style="color:#8ab4f8;font-weight:600;">**Leadership & Experience**</span><br/>
**Mentorship** – Quality software starts with confident, independent developers working in a predictable, repeatable environment where expectations are clear and feedback is fast. Standards are enforced by the system, not by people.<br/>
**How** – Clear code standards, automated style enforcement, version control, and build and test pipelines that surface problems early and consistently.<br/>
**Result** – People don’t feel watched; they trust the system, make good decisions independently, and deliver consistent, maintainable quality.<br/>
**Dealing with Problems** – People rarely set out to write bad code, so I usually treat it as a system failure before I treat it as a people problem.<br/>

<span style="color:#8ab4f8;font-weight:600;">**Patterns**</span><br/>
**CI/CD** – Automated pipelines that validate, package, and deploy changes consistently to reduce risk and feedback time.<br/>
**OOP** – A design approach that models behavior and responsibility through encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.<br/>
**DI** – A technique for supplying dependencies externally to reduce coupling and improve testability.<br/>
**IoC** – A broader architectural principle where control flow is inverted so frameworks orchestrate application behavior.<br/>
**MVC** – A pattern that separates input handling, business logic, and presentation concerns in request-driven applications.<br/>
**MVVM** – A UI pattern that separates visual presentation from state and behavior using binding and commands.<br/>
<span style="color:#8ab4f8;font-weight:600;">**Database**</span><br/>
**Database** – Persistent storage designed to model relationships, enforce integrity, and answer questions efficiently as data grows.<br/>
**Temp Tables** – Session-scoped, physically materialized tables used for intermediate results and complex query shaping.<br/>
**Table Variables** – Batch-scoped, memory-oriented tables optimized for small, predictable workloads.<br/>
**CTE** – A named, inline query that improves readability and enables recursion without creating intermediate storage.<br/>
**Stored Procedures** – Precompiled database routines that encapsulate logic, improve reuse, and centralize performance control.<br/>
**Views** – Virtual tables that abstract underlying schema while providing a stable query surface.<br/>
**Functions** – Reusable database expressions that return values and compose cleanly inside queries.<br/>
<span style="color:#8ab4f8;font-weight:600;">**WPF**</span><br/>
**WPF** – A desktop UI framework built around data binding and composition, where UI behavior emerges from state rather than code-behind.<br/>
**LINQ** – A declarative way to express data transformations so intent is clearer than the mechanics of looping and filtering.<br/>
**LINQ to SQL** – A lightweight ORM that maps relational data into objects, trading flexibility for simplicity and transparency.<br/>
**Entity Framework** – A full-featured ORM that prioritizes productivity and change tracking at the cost of some abstraction and control.<br/>
**Resources** – Centralized, reusable definitions for UI elements that promote consistency and reduce duplication.<br/>
**Data Binding** – A mechanism that synchronizes UI and application state so changes flow automatically without manual wiring.<br/>
**Converters** – Small translation layers that adapt data shapes or values for display without polluting business logic.<br/>
**Styles** – Declarative UI rules that enforce consistency and separate appearance from behavior.<br/>
**XAML** – A declarative markup language for describing UI structure, relationships, and bindings in a readable, tool-friendly way.<br/>
<span style="color:#8ab4f8;font-weight:600;">**.NET**</span><br/>
**.NET** – A managed runtime and ecosystem that emphasizes productivity, safety, and long-lived maintainable applications.<br/>
**Data Structures** – Fundamental ways to organize data to balance access speed, memory use, and algorithmic complexity.<br/>
**Collections** – Practical implementations of data structures optimized for common usage patterns and tradeoffs.<br/>
**Syntax** – Language features that reduce noise and make intent obvious when used consistently.<br/>
**Async/Await** – A language-level model for non-blocking I/O that improves scalability by freeing threads while work is waiting.<br/>
**Threading** – Explicit control over concurrent execution, used sparingly when coordination or performance requires it.<br/>
<span style="color:#8ab4f8;font-weight:600;">**Web**</span><br/>
**ASP.NET** – A web framework that translates HTTP requests into application intent while keeping business logic independent of transport.<br/>
**JavaScript** – The runtime language of the browser used to manage interaction, state, and asynchronous behavior on the client.<br/>
**React.js** – A component-based UI library that models interfaces as a function of state for predictable rendering and reuse.<br/>
**Bootstrap** – A CSS framework that provides a consistent, responsive layout system to accelerate UI development.<br/>
**jQuery** – A legacy DOM manipulation library that simplified cross-browser scripting before modern standards matured.<br/>
**CMS** – Content management platforms that separate content authoring from presentation and application logic.<br/>
<span style="color:#8ab4f8;font-weight:600;">**Tools**</span><br/>
**Git/GitHub** – Distributed version control for tracking change, enabling collaboration, and making work auditable and reversible.<br/>
**Visual Studio** – A full-featured IDE optimized for building, debugging, and refactoring .NET applications efficiently.<br/>
**SSMS** – A database management environment for querying, tuning, and administering SQL Server systems.<br/>
**Azure DevOps** – An integrated platform for source control, work tracking, and automated build and deployment pipelines.<br/>
**Linters** – Automated tools that enforce consistency and catch issues early by applying static analysis rules.<br/>
**Package Managers (NuGet, PIP)** – Dependency management systems that standardize how libraries are acquired, versioned, and updated.<br/>
